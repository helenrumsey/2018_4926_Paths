# 2018_4926_Paths
A compilation of the motion profiling paths used during the 2018 FRC season by team 4926
Each file included was created using a Java path generator and then used in a Labview autonomous code with the motion profiling aspects already included in a Talon SRX.  The paths pair up so that a left and right path is provided for its respective side.  Both paths are need for the code to correctly work.  these paths were used by 4926 throughout the competition season and work with 2018_4926_Tippecanoe and 2018_4926_Offseason.
